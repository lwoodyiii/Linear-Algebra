A system of linear equations (or a linear system) is a colleciton of one or more [linear equations](Linear-Equation.md) involving the same variables - say x1,...,xn.

A **solution** of the system is a list (s1, s2, ... sn) of numbers that makes each equation a true statement when the values s1,...,sn are substituted for x1,...,xn respectively. 

The set of all possible solutions is called the **soution set** of the linear system. Two linear systems are called **equivalent** if they have the same solution set.

A system of linear equations has
1. no solution, or
2. exactly one solution, or
3. infinitely many solutions.

A system of linear equations is said to be **consistent** if it has either one solution or infinitely many solutions; a system is **inconsistent** if it has no solution.

A sytem can be represented by a [Matrix](Matrix.md).
