A system of linear equations (or a linear system) is a colleciton of one or more [linear equations](Linear-Equation.md) involving the same variables - say x1,...,xn.

A solution of the system is a list (s1, s2, ... sn) of numbers that makes each equation a true statement when the values s1,...,sn are substituted for x1,...,xn respectively. 

The set of all possible solutions is called the soution set of the linear system. Two linear systems are called equivalent if they have the same solution set.
